For the past four years, I have been developing a pedagogy called "Athletic Software Engineering" (ASE).  This pedagogy involves a high intensity, time-constrained, and often stress-inducing approach to acquiring competency with software engineering skills.  Despite that, a survey of my students from AY 2016-2017 found that 90% of them prefer athletic software engineering to a traditional teaching approach. 

This essay presents the motivation for the pedagogy, a brief introduction to how I currently teach it, and the results of student evaluations of the method and my class.

## 1. Motivation

To motivate athletic software engineering, you need to first understand the goals of my software engineering course:

  1. *Acquire competency with a minimal technology stack for modern software application development.* In the case of my class, this "minimal" stack includes Javascript, git, GitHub, ESLint, IntelliJ, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, markdown, mocha, chai, npm, Meteor, MongoDB, and Galaxy.
    
  2. *Experience "design" problems.* Design problems occur at the code level (for example, how to structure code so that it is testable), as well as at the user interface level (for example, how to organize the presentation and manipulation of data so that user needs are satisfied).
  
  3. *Experience "process" problems.* Process problems involve group communication and coordination, and how to define, delegate, and manage tasks such that a group of developers can work together to create a functional application in a limited amount of time. 
  
  4. *Design and implement an application that solves a "real world" problem for UH students.* For example, students on a meal plan get a certain number of "points" each week for buying food, which do not roll over if unused. To solve this inefficiency, one team developed an app called "Manoa Dining Delivery", in which students can turn their expiring points into cash by purchasing food at the cafeteria and delivering it to another student on campus. Here is a portion of their home page:

These four goals build on each other: without competency with a technology stack, it is difficult to experience significant coding and user interface design problems.  Significant design problems are needed in order to provide a context for teams to experience process problems. And without the ability to solve both design and process problems, it is difficult to design and implement a "real world" application.

It is important to note that developing an application to solve a "real world problem" is not something that students can accomplish overnight.  I find they need a minimum of six weeks of the semester to focus on the final project, which leaves only 10 weeks to develop "competency" with the underlying tools and techniques. I developed Athletic Software Engineering to solve the pedagogical problem of developing competency with a significant set of tools and technologies in the short period of time available during a semester. 

## 2. Why "competency" is important

Consider the following development scenario, which is typical during final project development:
 
*A student chooses a development task (Issue 23) from the GitHub Project board, and moves it from "Backlog" to "In Progress". She then creates and publishes a new git branch called "Issue-23" off the project's master branch in which to accomplish the task. The task involves the creation of a new page containing a form in the application. She creates a new page template in Meteor along with a route to that page, several Javascript callback functions to manage form processing, and a responsive layout for the page using HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI. To store the results from the form, she extends a MongoDB collection with new fields, and writes a test using mocha and chai. In the IntelliJ IDEA editor, she notes any ESLint code style errors as they occur and removes them. When the page works correctly, she commits her branch to GitHub, merges the results into the master branch, and moves the task from "In Progress" to "Done".*

Notice that in this (very simple) development scenario, there are nevertheless explicit references to a dozen technologies (GitHub, git, Meteor, Javascript callbacks, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, MongoDB, mocha, chai, IntelliJ, and ESLint).  There are also implicit references to design problems (What information is being manipulated on that page? Is that the right information to manipulate? Is the chosen page the appropriate place to manipulate that information?) and process problems (Is that the appropriate task for that developer to work on right now? How might that task interact with others being worked on by others in the group? What communication should be occurring to make sure the developers do not implement conflicting code?)

One key insight motivating athletic software engineering is this: if a student is competent with the technology stack, then _and only then_ is it possible for that student to actively engage with "design" and "process" problems. If a student is not competent with the technology stack, then their focus devolves to understanding the technology stack, not the higher level "design" or "process" issues. For example, if a student does not understand how to implement a form in Semantic UI, then that becomes her focus of attention; it is impractical for her to compare and contrast design alternatives when she does not understand how to implement any of them.  

## 3. The intrinsic complexity of a software engineering technology stack
 
One interesting question is whether my course requires an overly complex technology stack.  In reality, I strive to require as minimal a technology stack as possible, such that whatever complexity results is intrinsic to the practice of software engineering. Consider that the 12 technologies in my class can be organized into the following categories, which I view as fairly central concepts in elementary software engineering:
 
  1. Programming Language (Javascript)
  2. Development Environment (Intellij IDEA)
  3. Project Management (GitHub issues and project boards)
  4. Configuration Management (git branch and merge)
  5. User Interface (HTML, CSS, Semantic UI)
  6. Testing and quality assurance (mocha, chai, ESLint)
  7. Application framework (Meteor, MongoDB)
  
Over the years, I have taught the class with many different combinations of technologies (Java rather than Javascript, Play rather than Meteor, Bootstrap rather than Semantic UI, Subversion rather than git, Google Project Hosting rather than GitHub, JUnit rather than mocha/chai), but these seven classes of software engineering technologies persist, as well as the need to obtain competency with them in order to experience "design" and "process" problems.

## 4. Efficient and effective development of competency

Athletic software engineering is a term I created to describe a set of interrelated teaching practices whose goal is to help students develop "competency" with basic software engineering skills prior to commencing their final project. If they achieve competency with most or all of the skills, then the final project enables them to develop experience solving design and process problems, makes it more likely that they will successfully implement a "minimum viable product", and results in a significantly richer educational outcome.  
 
While a description of athletic software engineering sufficient for classroom implementation is beyond the scope of this essay, here are some key features that distinguish it from other approaches.

**Weekly module schedule.**  The class is organized into a sequence of "modules", each lasting one week. If my class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then each module begins on Friday and lasts until the end of class on the following Thursday.  Students work on "practice WODs" from Friday to Monday, do a "group WOD" on Tuesday, an (optional) Amy WOD after that, and an "in class" WOD on Thursday to complete the module. Here's an illustration:

<img class="ui bordered responsive image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ModuleSchedule.png">

**Skill acquisition, not concept acquisition.** Students are evaluated based upon their ability to complete a task, not on their ability to discuss a concept. For example, a test module would evaluate the ability of a student to define and implement a unit test, not evaluate the ability of the student to describe the difference between a black box test and a white box test. 

**Workout of the day (WOD).**  I have adapted the CrossFit "WOD" to Athletic Software Engineering. In ASE, a "WOD" is a problem that requires the student to exercise one or more skills both correctly (i.e. such that the problem is solved) and efficiently (i.e. within a time limit). There is an upper bound on the time allowed to solve a problem (which typically makes it impossible to "google your way to the answer".) My heuristic for setting the upper bound is to time myself solving the problem, then double this "expert" time to obtain the upper limit for students.  This upper bound is referred to as the "DNF" time (or "Did Not Finish"). This past year, I assigned around 35 WODs each semester, which ranged from 5 minutes to 40 minutes to complete, with most WODs having a DNF time of somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes.

**Practice WODs.**  Each module provides several "practice WODs" to be done as homework between Friday and Tuesday. Practice WODs differ from traditional homework assignments in several ways. First, each practice WOD indicates, in addition to the problem to be solved, the time limit for successful completion of the WOD.  Second, each practice WOD includes a video of me solving the problem, and timing myself while doing so. Third, I typically instruct students to first attempt to solve the problem by themselves without watching my solution video, and time themselves while they do so. If they have not solved the problem by the DNF time, then they should stop at that point and watch my solution video, then try to solve the problem again from scratch, timing their second attempt as well.  If they cannot complete the assignment before the DNF time again, they should review the video and keep attempting to solve the problem until they can do it within the specified time interval. 

Some students admit that they do not follow this procedure, although most learn quickly that this is actually the most efficient way to acquire competency and avoid the dreaded DNF on the "in class WOD" (see below).

**Group WOD.** The Tuesday class is dedicated to one or more "Group WODs".  For each Group WOD, I randomly split the class into groups of two. I then provide a new problem for them to solve using the same skills they (hopefully) developed from the practice WODs.  However, they are now working in a group, and they have to work concurrently (in most cases, I ask that they both complete typing each line of code before either can type the next one.)  Once again, there is a time limit, although the limit is elevated since working concurrently can slow things down, and because I want to encourage them to discuss issues as they arise during the solution process.
 
The Group WOD fulfills several pedagogical goals. First, it provides a self-assessment procedure for students; they can see if their work on the practice WOD has actually prepared them to successfully solve a new problem. Second, it provides an engaging classroom learning environment; rather than working silently alone, they get to work with another student. By the end of the semester, most students have had 1-on-1 time with most other students in the class. Third, it incentivizes students to do the practice WODs, since they know that they will need to demonstrate the skill in class in Tuesday with another student, and this creates social pressure to prepare.  Finally, doing the Group WOD helps the students acquire more competency with the skill itself. 

**Amy WOD.** During academic year 2016-17, my TA's first name was Amy and she held a weekly, voluntary meeting to provide another opportunity to do a timed WOD. Amy WODs are individual and timed, and after the conclusion she goes over the solution. Amy WODs were usually on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoons or evenings, after the students had (hopefully) finished the Practice and Group WODs.

**In class WOD.** The Thursday class period ends the week-long module, and it consists primarily of the "in class WOD", which is yet another individual WOD, but this time it "counts": almost all of the points for the module are based upon the student's ability to solve the problem presented in the In Class WOD both correctly and within the specified time limit.  In class WODs are generally graded on an "all or nothing" basis: if you solve the problem correctly and within the time limit, you get 100% of the available points.  If you don't, you get zero.  

The combination of extensive "training" throughout the week in the form of practice, group, and Amy WODs, followed by a single "performance" to demonstrate the skill, is similar to many athletic (and artistic) disciplines. It is designed to help students learn to take the "training" seriously, just as athletes (and artists) take training seriously, because it is the only way to increase the odds that they will succeed at "game time".  
 
## 5. Student evaluation of Athletic Software Engineering
 
Most students report that the WOD-based athletic software engineering pedagogy is very stressful. To obtain a detailed perspective, I ask students each semester to complete a questionnaire about their view of WODs and Athletic Software Engineering. Here are the results for AY 2016-2017. There were a total of 119 students across the four sections of ICS 314, and 86 filled out the survey, for a 72% response rate. The following sections present data from the most relevant questions:

### Do you prefer ASE to the traditional way of teaching?

90% of the students surveyed prefer Athletic Software Engineering. Comments include:

* I got accepted to an internship from a company and they put me through 3 rounds of 'WODs' to test me before giving me the offer. I think the WODs in 314 helped.
* It helps students "stay on their toes"
* When I am learning a problem, I feel better when I see a video to help me understand the process better.
* I'm terrible at working under pressure. So I've had poor results this semester. But I think that the WODs have helped me get a little better at keeping composure.

### Are repeating the WODs helpful?

84% of the students surveyed indicated that repeating WODs were helpful either all the time or part of the time. Comments include:

* Helps you learn your mistakes and why you make these mistakes.
* Yes, especially for the Meteor WODs: naturally, one get's better with practice.
* I only repeated the practice WODs when I couldn't finish or took too long to finish.  After repeating them a second or third time, I was able to understand the material better and better each time.
* Keep practicing the WODs makes us understand the materials more deeper.


### Was the in-class, graded WOD helpful for learning?

91% of the students surveyed found the in-class WOD to help in learning. Comments include:

* Yes, forced me to study intensely.
* Having in-class graded WODs are what drove me to really take the time to study and practice the given assignments at home
* I think that the stress placed on coming to class for the WOD especially and the time constraint made us see if we really knew the material.
* I personally don't think having the in-class graded WOD was helpful for learning since learning new material takes time, practice, and continued usage until that new material becomes natural.

### Did WODs help you become more confident in your software development capabilities?

80% of the students surveyed responded that WODs increased their confidence. Comments include:

* Before taking this class, I definitely lacked in my software development skills.  I still have lots of room for improvement, but the WODs and the athletic software engineering learning style definitely forced me to put more effort into practicing, learning, and ultimately improving such skills.
* Yes, each time I have successfully completed a WOD, whether easy or difficult, I felt accomplished and more confident in my software development capabilities.
* Yes, after doing these WODs, I felt that I have been able to better solve problems that I was having problems with and now have solution for similar problems that I have came across.
* Doing WODs has definitely made me more confident about my software development capabilities and my understanding of JavaScript. When I got to the JavaScript section of my company interview, I was praying to God that it was similar to ICS 314-- which it sorta was (minus the functional programming and Meteor part).
* Not really. It just forced me to actually understand the material before the WOD.

### Did WOD-based homework help you to be more focused?

79% of the students surveyed responded that WOD-based homework helped them to be more focused. Comments include:

* Yeah. Since there's a time limit, it really motivates you to try and be focused and finish on time.
* Yes, the practice WODs allowed me to hone my focus on what to study for rather than reading a book that shows theory. The constant coding was an excellent way to actually learn how to code.
* Yes. The video lectures were also very good. I was never bored watching them.
* Not really because there is still potential to have distractions since the practice WODs are on the computer.

    
## 6. Student evaluation of ICS 314, AY 2016-2017
 
As noted above, the athletic software engineering pedagogy occupies just over half the course, with the remainder dedicated to a real world project in which students will hopefully experience software engineering design and process problems.  So, some additional insight into ASE might be gained by reviewing the end-of-semester course evaluation data. Since 2007, I have been publishing all my course evaluations, and they are all available for review [here](https://www.hawaii.edu/ecafe/published-results.html?id=1912). The following presents a summary of AY 2016-2017 course evaluation data that seems most relevant to this essay.

119 students completed ICS 314 across four sections during AY 2016-2017.  115 of them completed the end-of-semester course evaluation, for a response rate of 97%.  

There are three Likert Scale questions that seem particularly relevant to this essay:

| Question | Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Neutral | Agree | Strongly Agree |
|----------|-------------------|----------|---------|-------|----------------|
|  The instructor fulfilled the goals of the course     |  1  | 1 |  1  | 30   |  81   |
|  I gained a good understanding of concepts/principles in this field.    |  1  | 1 |  9  | 29   |  75   |
|  The instructional materials (e.g., texts, handouts, etc.) were relevant to course objectives. |  1  | 0 |  3  | 32   |  77   |


These responses indicate that at least 90% of the students surveyed agreed or strongly agreed with each of these statements. 

The free response data is harder to summarize in a useful manner. Here are two comments that I find particularly revealing:

* A very rewarding course if one has the motivation to put time into it. Focuses on web application development through JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Great class to hone your skills if you are somewhat knowledgeable in these areas. If not, you WILL learn it. Depends on one's individual coding skills which will dictate how much work needs to be put in. It is totally brutal if one is a total beginner since you are only given a week to learn new concepts on your own from scratch and use your skills the following week to implement what you "learned." Making friends with others so you have someone to reach out to would help tremendously so you don't end up getting swamped by stuff. Professor seems very open to providing help though, but asking peers is probably more within many student's comfort zones. If you really don't know it, you MUST ask for help. There is no time to spend hours figuring out a basic concept on your own, especially since you have other classes and you will be 'expected' to know it later on. I am a strong coder myself though, and kept up just fine, without watching all of the video tutorials. It leans more towards an independent study online class with actual class time just being dedicated to WODS/questions/project work/get to know your peers. No paper exams or textbook to study. TLDR: Not for the weak. Best class for aspiring web developers. Help is always available. (Fall 2016, Section 002)

* ...for the first half of the semester I questioned whether this was a software engineering course at all. I learned how to code in Javascript, make basic web pages, and faff about with a web framework. It was only when we got to the final project that it felt like we were learning anything about software engineering (and actually learned said web framework for real). Here the first half of the course came to make sense as buildup towards actual software engineering in the form of the final project. I think the final project was the best part of the course. I strongly believe that the best way to learn something is by actually doing it. (Spring 2017, Section 002)

## 7. Conclusions

After four years of using Athletic Software Engineering in the classroom, I find it to be the most effective method I have discovered so far for teaching students the basic skills necessary to experience real world software engineering design and process problems.  Perhaps counter-intuitively, student feedback is very positive, despite the pressure and intensity of the pedagogy.  This, ultimately, does not surprise me: as long as the rewards appear commensurate with the struggle, most students are willing to work hard.  

That said, I see many, many opportunities for improvement to the course.  I want to develop technology to simplify the development of professional portfolios, which should resolve some of the problems encountered by some students. I want to provide more practice WODs, and improve the pedagogical quality of the current WODs.  There are some additional software engineering concepts (including continuous integration, performance evaluation, and design patterns) that I would like to introduce if time permits. Just keeping the materials current with the fast moving world of software engineering and application development requires constant investment of time and energy.
