For the past four years, I have been refining a pedagogy called "Athletic Software Engineering" that I developed as my latest approach to teaching software engineering.   This essay presents my current approach and the results of student evaluations of the method and my class.

In a nutshell, my goals for my third semester students are:

  1. *To acquire competency with a minimal technology stack for modern software application development.* In the case of my class, this "minimal" stack includes Javascript, git, GitHub, ESLint, IntelliJ, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, markdown, mocha, chai, npm, Meteor, MongoDB, and Galaxy.
    
  2. *To confront and solve "design" problems.* Design problems occur at the code level (for example, how to structure code so that it is testable), as well as at the user interface level (for example, how to organize the presentation and manipulation of data so that user needs are satisfied).
  
  3. *To confront and solve "process" problems.* Process problems involve group communication and coordination, and how to define, delegate, and manage tasks such that a group of developers can work together to create a functional application in a limited amount of time. 
  
  4. *Invent an application that solves a "real world" problem for UH students.* For example, students on a meal plan get a certain number of "points" each week for buying food, which do not roll over if unused. To solve this inefficiency, one of my student teams developed an app called "Manoa Dining Delivery", in which students can turn their expiring points into cash by purchasing food at the cafeteria and delivering it to another student on campus. Here is their home page:

These goals build on each other: without competency with a technology stack, it is difficult to successfully address significant coding and user interface design problems.  Significant design problems are needed in order to provide a context for team work with significant process problems. And without the ability to confront and address both design and process problems, it is difficult to create solutions to real world problems (at least within the boundaries of a single semester.)

Furthermore, developing an application to solve a "real world problem" that provides opportunities to experience significant design and process problems is not something that can be done overnight.  I find that students need a minimum of six weeks for the final project in order to achieve something they can be proud of, which leaves only 10 weeks to develop "competency" with the underlying tools and techniques. I developed Athletic Software Engineering to solve the pedagogical problem of developing competency with a significant set of tools and technologies within the context of an undergraduate course.
