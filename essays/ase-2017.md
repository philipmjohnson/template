For the past four years, I have been refining a pedagogy called "Athletic Software Engineering" that I developed as my latest approach to teaching software engineering.   In a nutshell, I want my third semester students to leave with the class with the following:

  1. Acquire competency with a minimal technology stack for modern software application development. In the case of my class, this "minimal" stack includes Javascript, git, GitHub, ESLint, IntelliJ, mocha, chai, Meteor, MongoDB, markdown, npm, HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI.
    
  2. Solve "design" problems. Design problems occur at the code level (for example, how to structure code so that it is testable), and at the UI level (for example, how to organize the presentation of information so that users can effectively use an application).
  
  3. Solve "process" problems. Process problems involve group communication and coordination, and how to define, delegate, and manage tasks such that a group of students can work together to create a functional application in a limited amount of time. 
  
Oh, and I also want them to make significant progress toward the development of a real world application that solves a significant problem for UH students. For example, students at UH on a meal plan get a certain number of meal plan "points" per week, which do not roll over if unused. To solve this inefficiency, one of my student teams developed an app called "Manoa Dining Delivery", in which students can use up their unused points by purchasing food at the cafeteria and delivering it to another student on campus, who then pays them cash for the food and delivery. Here is their home page:
