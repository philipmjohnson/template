In Spring of 2017, I was part of a seven person executive committee that produced the [March for Science--Hawaii](http://marchforsciencehawaii.info/).  Without any prior experience, we developed an organizing committee of over 70 people, had a verified attendence of over 2500 people on the day of the march, and ended the day with a budget surplus of $4,000 with which we are creating a science educator grant program.  Because we were learning while we were doing, we made a variety of mistakes along the way, even though the march was ultimately a success and exceeded our expectations.

I got involved with the March for Science not because I knew how to organize a demonstration, but because I felt compelled by its mission to participate. For those of you who find yourself in a similar situation, I would like to offer the following tips to help you bootstrap your efforts successfully. 

Discuss organization: executive committee, subcommittees.
You need more than email. We used Slack.
First step: grow the organizing committee. 

In the early days, our primary directive to new committee members was to find at least one friend who would also like to join.  

Raise funds with a killer tshirt design. 

get a great designer to volunteer their expertise to design a nice logo, then use Bonfire to raise the funds.
  
Other:

* UH was really supportive.  
* Political, not partisan. (attempt to attract republicans).  Science first (climate change, GMOs).
* Get lucky with your executive committee.  
* put picture at top, video(s) in middle, press and coverage links at the bottom.
* Now we're working on three ongoing projects.
